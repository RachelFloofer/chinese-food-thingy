YEAH BITCHES, I MADE A FUCKING CHINESE FOOD APP FOR MAC, DEAL WITH IT.  
because apparently the world needs more cursed swiftui nonsense.  

[download the shitty app here, drag it to applications, and curse urself for downloading this](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22656034/HappyChinese.zip)


---

## what the fuck it does

- lists some goddamn delicious dishes  
- shows a little ramen bowl rating because why the hell not üçú  
- shows a recipe so you don‚Äôt starve like a dumbass  
- cute glassy buttons and a gradient that makes your eyes pop  
- basically lets you pretend you‚Äôre a chef without leaving your couch  

---

## how to use

double-click the .app and pray it works.  
or, for the CLI nerds who love pain:

swift build

(if it breaks, cry. swift doesn‚Äôt give a shit üò≠)

---

## why tho?

because i wanted to. also because i‚Äôm the same cursed weirdo who made [winapi-mac-chimera](https://github.com/RachelFloofer/winapi-hellscape.git), that steaming pile of objective c++ bullshit pretending to be windows api.  
yeah it‚Äôs cursed, yeah it probably won‚Äôt work right, i don‚Äôt care, i MADE IT.

## contribute?

sure, pull requests welcome but i‚Äôll probably just laugh and ignore it :3

## license
